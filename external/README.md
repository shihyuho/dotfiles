# External Assets

This directory stores external-source shell assets that are managed by this repository and linked into `$HOME`.

## Managed Files

- `kubectl_aliases`
  - Source: https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases
  - Symlink target: `~/.kubectl_aliases`

- `kube-ps1.sh`
  - Source: https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1
  - Symlink target: `~/.kube-ps1.sh`

## Related Commands

- Install links: `make install`
- Remove links: `make uninstall`
- Verify links: `make test`

## Not Managed Here

The following files may still exist under `$HOME`, but are generated by external tools and are not managed by `install.sh`/`uninstall.sh`:

- `~/.fzf.zsh`
- `~/.key-bindings.zsh`
- `~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh`

### How to Regenerate Local-Only Files

- `~/.fzf.zsh`, `~/.key-bindings.zsh`
  - Generated by fzf installation scripts. On Homebrew systems, run the fzf install script in the brew prefix.

- `~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh`
  - Install/download from iTerm2 shell integration and place it in your home directory.
