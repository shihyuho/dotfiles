# Keybinding Fixes for Zellij (macOS)
# Treat left option as Alt/Meta
macos-option-as-alt = left

# Unbind default Alt+Left/Right to allow Zellij to receive them
keybind = alt+left=unbind
keybind = alt+right=unbind

# Explicitly unbind Ghostty defaults that conflict with Zellij
# These ensure Alt+<key> combinations pass through to Zellij
keybind = alt+f=unbind
keybind = alt+h=unbind
keybind = alt+j=unbind
keybind = alt+k=unbind
keybind = alt+l=unbind
keybind = alt+n=unbind
keybind = alt+w=unbind
keybind = alt+i=unbind
keybind = alt+o=unbind
keybind = alt+p=unbind

# Map Command+Left/Right to Home/End
# Try Ctrl+A/E (Emacs-style) which is more universally supported
# These work in most shells and applications including OpenCode
keybind = cmd+left=text:\x01
keybind = cmd+right=text:\x05

# Alternative: If you prefer Home/End sequences, uncomment these instead:
# keybind = cmd+left=text:\x1b[H
# keybind = cmd+right=text:\x1b[F

# Enable system clipboard integration
# Command+C/V for copy/paste (use OSC 52 clipboard passthrough)
clipboard-read = allow
clipboard-write = allow

# Explicitly bind Command+C/V to clipboard actions
# This ensures it works even inside TUI apps like OpenCode
keybind = cmd+c=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = cmd+v=paste_from_clipboard

# Let Command+C always copy to system clipboard
copy-on-select = false

# Theme
theme = Material Darker

# Font
font-family = "FiraCode Nerd Font"
font-size = 14
font-feature = calt
font-feature = liga

# Window
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4
window-decoration = true
window-save-state = always

# Shell integration
shell-integration = zsh

# Auto-start Zellij
# Create a new session with random name each time (independent windows)
# Use full path because Ghostty doesn't load shell PATH yet
command = /opt/homebrew/bin/zellij
