# Timeline: 2026-02-13

## when

2026-02-13

## change

- Phase 1 exploration was completed.
- Existing `zellij` and `yazi` assets were confirmed in Brewfile, install links, and zsh tool configs.
- Remaining gap was narrowed to missing `config/yazi/theme.toml` plus pending integration verification tasks.

## why

This reduces implementation risk by avoiding duplicate work and keeps effort focused on unresolved, high-value items.

## source_ref

- `task_plan.md`
- `findings.md`
- `progress.md`
